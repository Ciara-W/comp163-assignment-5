For Challenge 1 I chose a while loop because the number of iterations is unknown and so I can get the sequence.

For challenge 2 I used a for loop because the number of iterations is known and so I used the range function to find them.

For challenge 3 I used a nested loop because it required me to loop the rows and columns so that I could have an output.

As for AI, I used it to help me with the while loop because it confused me at first.
